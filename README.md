# The-Gaming-Room-Software-Design-Document


# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
   
  The Gaming Room runs a game called Draw It or Lose it in the Android app store and is looking expand by developing a web-based game version of the game for multiple platforms. We expect to accomplish this by programming the game with design patterns which can be adapted to different platforms with a few changes.

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  The well-structured document guides the client to execute the best decision based on pertinent information and can make adjustment and corrections as required.
    
# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  Coding with a clear starting point is critical to ensuring that expectations are clearly set and the development team does not deviates from the intended goal.
   
# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  I would have a meeting with the client and discuss their concerns and include their feedback into the document. This product is being developed for a client and they should be deeply involved in the development process from the start.
   
# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  A program that does not serve a purpose for its users is obsolete. Therefore, those needs must be taken into consideration and fulfilled to the best of the company's and development team's capabilities.
   
# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  Having a clearly delineated document describing each major sector in the development process brought up questions about the design of the program that were addressed early in the development process. This can alleviate a lot of reworks in the long run and make the development in general a lot more efficient.
